## Now anyone can try this tool out through https://sat-gpt-git-main-naren219.vercel.app!

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

Passage:

"This passage is from Lydia Minatoya, The Strangeness of Beauty. ©1999 by Lydia Minatoya. The setting is Japan in 1920. Chie and her daughter Naomi are members of the House of Fuji, a noble family. Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was that it? Had he followed form—had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a go-between—would Chie have been more receptive? He came on a winter’s eve. He pounded on the door while a cold rain beat on the shuttered veranda, so at first Chie thought him only the wind. The maid knew better. Chie heard her soft scuttling footsteps, the creak of the door. Then the maid brought a calling card to the drawing room, for Chie. Chie was reluctant to go to her guest; perhaps she was feeling too cozy. She and Naomi were reading at a low table set atop a charcoal brazier. A thick quilt spread over the sides of the table so their legs were tucked inside with the heat. “Who is it at this hour, in this weather?” Chie questioned as she picked the name card off the maid’s lacquer tray. “Shinoda, Akira. Kobe Dental College,” she read. Naomi recognized the name. Chie heard a soft intake of air. “I think you should go,” said Naomi. Akira was waiting in the entry. He was in his early twenties, slim and serious, wearing the black military-style uniform of a student. As he bowed—his hands hanging straight down, a black cap in one, a yellow oil-paper umbrella in the other—Chie glanced beyond him. In the glistening surface of the courtyard’s rain-drenched paving stones, she saw his reflection like a dark double. “Madame,” said Akira, “forgive my disruption, but I come with a matter of urgency.” His voice was soft, refined. He straightened and stole a deferential peek at her face. In the dim light his eyes shone with sincerity. Chie felt herself starting to like him. “Come inside, get out of this nasty night. Surely your business can wait for a moment or two.” “I don’t want to trouble you. Normally I would approach you more properly but I’ve received word of a position. I’ve an opportunity to go to America, as dentist for Seattle’s Japanese community.” “Congratulations,” Chie said with amusement. “That is an opportunity, I’m sure. But how am I involved?” Even noting Naomi’s breathless reaction to the name card, Chie had no idea. Akira’s message, delivered like a formal speech, filled her with maternal amusement. You know how children speak so earnestly, so hurriedly, so endearingly about things that have no importance in an adult’s mind? That’s how she viewed him, as a child."

passage 2 (works)

From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt outdo the potential drawbacks of its production. 

change all instances of the word "outdo" with a synonym from the below choices that best maintains the flow of passage 2. Pay attention to the purpose of the passage and which synonym matches up most with it. Output both a letter choice and an explanation of why: 

A) outdo 
B) defeat 
C) outperform 
D) outweigh 

Answer: Choice D is the best answer because it matches up with the purpose of the passage, which is to discuss how the advantages of Greek yogurt outweigh its potential drawbacks. Choice A is not the right answer because "outdo" does not match up with this purpose. Choice B is not the right answer because "defeat" implies that one side has completely won over another, while in this case both sides have advantages and disadvantages. Choice C is not the right answer because "outperform" implies that one side has done better than another, while in this case both sides have advantages and disadvantages.

passage 2 (works)

Nutritionists consider Greek yogurt to be a healthy food: it is an excellent source of calcium and protein, serves to be a digestive aid, and it contains few calories in its unsweetened low- and non-fat forms. 

Choose an answer choice below (a, b, c, d) that best serves as a replacement to the word "to be" in the passage and write the explanation for your chosen answer with and why the other choices are not right with specific english grammar reasoning using this format "choice [insert choice letter here] is not the right answer because ...": 
A) to be 
B) as 
C) like 
D) for 

Answer: Choice B is the best answer because it serves as a conjunction to connect two clauses. Choice A is not the right answer because "to be" does not serve as a conjunction in this sentence. Choice C is not the right answer because "like" does not serve as a conjunction in this sentence. Choice D is not the right answer because "for" does not serve as a conjunction in this sentence.


question 3: They can add it to livestock feed as a protein supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. 

Find a choice below that contains the best replacement for this phrase "can pollute waterways " in question 3 and give reasons why the other choices are incorrect: 
A) can pollute waterways 
B) can pollute waterway's, 
C) could have polluted waterways, 
D) has polluted waterway’s, 

A) can pollute waterways - This is the best replacement for this phrase because it is in the present tense, which matches with the rest of the sentence. The other choices are incorrect because they are either in a different tense or contain an apostrophe that should not be there.


passage 1 
Also, because it is more concentrated, Greek yogurt contains slightly more protein per serving, thereby helping people stay satiated for longer periods of time. 

change all instances of the word "satiated" with a synonym from the below choices that best maintains the flow of passage 2. Pay attention to the purpose of the passage and which synonym matches up most with it. Choose the answer to each question that most effectively improves the quality of writing in the passage or that makes the passage conform to the conventions of standard written English. If the word "satiated" is the best word in context, select "A". Output both a letter choice and an explanation of why: 

A) satiated 
B) fulfilled 
C) complacent 
D) sufficient 

A) satiated - Satiated is the best choice because it conveys the idea that people are feeling full and satisfied after eating Greek yogurt, which is the purpose of this passage. The other options do not convey this same meaning as effectively. Fulfilled implies a sense of accomplishment or satisfaction, complacent suggests contentment without any effort, and sufficient implies only enough to meet one's needs.
